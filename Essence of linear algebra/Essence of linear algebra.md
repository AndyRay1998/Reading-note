AB != BA
but (AB)C = A(BC), because the sequence physically is from right to left.

## 7 Inverse matrices, column space and null space
- finding weighting (x) that combine A to reach v in 3D space ![[Pasted image 20220619170553.png]]
- det = 0 means squish to lower dimension
- rank: how many dimensions left after the transformation
		- rank 1: line
		- rank 2: plane
